        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Organ transplantation is a critical medical procedure that saves lives. However, the demand for donated organs far exceeds the available supply. Compounding the issue, donated organs have a limited preservation time, making rapid matching and assessment crucial. Traditional medical systems face challenges such as insufficient sample sizes, low data processing efficiency, and unequal resource distribution. These limitations create a pressing need for innovative solutions. By leveraging Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and advanced risk prediction models like OPOM, we can improve graft survival predictions and enhance resource allocation and patient care.</p>

        <h2>Challenges in Organ Transplantation</h2>
        <p>AI has the potential to address many challenges in the organ transplant process. By screening and analyzing compatibility between potential donors and recipients, AI can significantly shorten decision-making time and improve matching accuracy. However, integrating AI also introduces challenges, such as ensuring the accuracy and fairness of algorithms, protecting data privacy, and addressing potential biases in AI models.</p>

    <!-- ANNs Section -->
    <section id="anns">
        <h2>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in Transplant Matching</h2>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Increase overall accuracy (NN-CCR).</li>
            <li>Reduce false positives (NN-MS).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Method:</strong> Artificial neural networks function like the human brain by analyzing vast datasets, including HLA matching, age, health conditions, and medical history. These networks assign weights to various factors, dynamically adjusting them based on historical transplant data. ANNs are organized into multiple layers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Receives data, such as the patient's demographics and health conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Processes data through complex calculations, learning patterns, and relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> Provides the final prediction, such as graft survival likelihood or transplant success.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="chart.png" alt="chart" class="chart">
        <p><strong>Results:</strong>
            ANNs have demonstrated superior performance in predicting graft survival (90.79% accuracy, AUC 0.81) and graft loss (71.42% accuracy, AUC 0.82) compared to traditional models. For kidney transplants, an ANN-based model achieved a C-statistic of 0.637, slightly surpassing the Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) model's 0.6, enhancing personalized decision-making for kidney offers.

    <!-- OPOM Section -->
    <section id="opom">
        <h2>Risk Prediction Using OPOM</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Assess whether a recipient should accept an organ based on their mortality risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Method:</strong> OPOM, derived from the OCT algorithm, outperforms traditional models like MELD in predicting three-month mortality or waitlist removal. It uses a classification tree approach to evaluate parameters such as sex, race, cause of liver failure, demographics, cumulative wait time, blood type, average age, and BMI. The model predicts the probability of patient mortality or unsuitability for transplant within three months.</p>
        <p><strong>Results:</strong> With a dataset of 1,618,966 observations, OPOM reduced mortality by 417.96 deaths in 6,139 liver transplantations, highlighting its effectiveness in improving patient outcomes. External validation is pending.</p>

        <h2>Future Perspectives</h2>
        <p>AI holds transformative potential for organ transplantation, streamlining decision-making processes and enhancing efficiency. However, several challenges remain. Issues such as accuracy, algorithmic biases, lack of explainability, and ethical concerns must be addressed. Transparency, equity, and cross-disciplinary collaboration will be critical to ensuring AI’s responsible integration into medical practices. By addressing these challenges, AI can help create a more equitable and effective organ transplant system.</p>
